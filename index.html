                        Like most art collections around the world, a majority of the TATE collection is 
                        composed of male artists. To better understand why this gender inbalance is happening, 
                        we wish to know more about the few female artists in this collection. Where are they from?
                        When did they live? When did they create the artwork that hangs in the TATE galleries today?
                        Perhaps answering these questions can help understand why so few women are represented in these
                        galleries and shed light on the diverse perspectives female artists bring to the table.

                        Here we see that a majority of the artwork in the TATE gallery created by female artists was both finished 
                        and acquired from the late 20th century onward. This visualization shows how women have been under represented 
                        in the art space compared to their male counterparts. Even today as the TATE continues to acquire more artwork
                        created by female artists, women are still under represented in the gallery.
