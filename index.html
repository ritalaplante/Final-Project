        This section explores patterns in gender at the TATE. This section aims to explore the prevelance of female artists
        within the TATE collection and the time periods during which these female artists created the majority of their artwork.

          Like most art collections around the world, a majority of the TATE
          collection is composed of male artists. The lack of female representation means
          it's important for us to learn more about these artists. For instance, we can ask 
          the following questions: 
          <ul>
            <li>When did they create their work?</li>
            <li>What mediums did they use?</li>
            <li>When did they live and where did they live?</li>

      <div class = "areachart-description">
        <p>
          Most female artists of the TATE collection were not creating art until the 20th century. Simillarly, TATE galleries
          were not collecting art created by female artists until the 20th century. Women were largely excluded from the art scene for 
          many centuries, and even today their work often is under-collected. Notice:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries there is very little change in art created and collected.
              Art created by female artists during these periods was very rare.

            Like most art collections around the world, a majority of the TATE
            collection is composed of male artists. To better understand why
            this gender inbalance is happening, we wish to know more about the
            few female artists in this collection. Where are they from? When did
            they live? When did they create the artwork that hangs in the TATE
            galleries today? Perhaps answering these questions can help
            understand why so few women are represented in these galleries and
            shed light on the diverse perspectives female artists bring to the
            table.

            Here we see that a majority of the artwork in the TATE gallery
            created by female artists was both finished and acquired from the
            late 20th century onward. This visualization shows how women have
            been under represented in the art space compared to their male
            counterparts. Even today as the TATE continues to acquire more
            artwork created by female artists, women are still under represented
            in the gallery.
