            About Refusing to HesiTATE
          </h1>
          <p id="description">
            Out motivation with this project was to highligh female artists in the TATE collection because they are so under-represented 
            in the gallery. Specifically, we wanted to use our webpage to highlight lesser-known artists and to put artists' artwork on full
            display. The point of this site is not only to display trends within the collection, but it is also to put the incorporate
            the artwork into the visualization. We used open-source data about the TATE collection's artwork and artists to achieve this 
            goal.

          <h2>Data Processing</h2>
          <div class = "processing-desc">
              Our primary dataset was a combination of two datasets was released by the TATE gallery in London. The first of the two 
              datasets contained artists information such as an unique artist ID, artist name, artist gender, artist place of birth, 
              artist place of death, artist year of birth and artist year of death. The second dataset contained information about different 
              artworks in the TATE collection. This dataset included field such as artist, artist ID, artwork title, date of creation, 
              date of acquistion, and links to the artwork on the TATE gallery website. <br><br>
              To create one cohesive dataset we joined these two datasets together by artist ID and then filtered them to create a dataset 
              containing only artwork created by female artists. From here we had to perform some data cleaning to create concise 
              and clear visualizations. The primary task we performed was normalizing medium names for the "Meet Popular Artists" visualization. 
              We found that many of the same mediums were listed under different names, so we had to identify these duplicates 
              and normalize the medium names accordingly. <br><br> 
              Addiotionally, the visualizations focussed on image color required a fair bit of data cleaning. We first extracted 
              the colors of each artwork from the thumbnail url provided in the dataset. We then used a js library called Color Thief which 
              grabs the primary color and the palette of 10 colors in each image. We then used the attributes collected by Color Thief in our
              visualizations. In order to save the website loading time, we used the combined dataset instead of performing color extraction 
              every time we run the program. <br><br>
              Information about Color Thief can be found <a href = https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/#api> here</a>.
